# Slurm wrapper

This is a simple wrapper for sending jobs to SLURM at QI.

### Default installation
Place this directory in your home, adding it to the path.
The first time that *sb.pl* is run, it will attempt creating two subdirectories:
 - ~/slurm/jobs: to store jobs scripts
 - ~/slurm/logs: to store logs, STDERR and STDOUT
